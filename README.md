# Battletech_LessHeadInjuries
Machinegun bullets shouldn't do jack to a fully armoured head.

Sets armour hits to the head to only cause pilot injuries if the damage does 10 damage or more in a single instance.

Sets structure hits to the head to only cause head injuries if the damage does 5 damage or more in a single instance. 
This may be a bit academic if it's something like an assault mech that manages to score a head hit on your mech.
